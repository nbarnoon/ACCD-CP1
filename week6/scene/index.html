  <h1>Canvas Dashboard Interface in Blender</h1>
  <p>
    This work continues from my Week 5 Blender project, where I first started building the room scene.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started creating my scene by imagining the context in which users would interact with my redesigned Canvas desktop dashboard. 
    The end users are mostly undergraduate and graduate students, so I decided to build a <strong>student room setting</strong> â€” 
    a simple, functional workspace with a table, chair, desk lamp, bamboo plant (in progress), and a laptop (in progress). 
    This is the environment where students would use the desktop version of Canvas.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Room setup</h2>
  <p>
    I first added a cube, scaled it, and deleted two of its faces to make it look like a room. I also used the <strong>boolean modifier</strong> 
    (Difference) on the left wall to cut out a window shape. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Later I changed the approach: I deleted that box and rebuilt the room
    using three planes for the walls and floor.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Materials</h2>


  <p>
    I hid the floor and walls so I could focus on the furniture. Then I
    started adding materials in the <strong>Shading tab.</strong> 
  </p>

  <h3>Desk/Table</h3>
  <p>
    For the table, I gave it a wood texture with a blue/green tint using <strong>Shading tab.</strong> 
  </p>

  <h3>Chair</h3>
  <p>
    For the chair, I added a leather material to the sitting area and chosed grayish-blue color for chair legs.
  </p>

  <h3>Bamboo Plant</h3>
  <p>
    I kept going and added materials to the pot and the bamboo plant.
  </p>

  <h3>Laptop</h3>
  <p>
    For the laptop I modeled earlier, and the keyboard I made using <strong>cubes
    + an Array modifier</strong>, I also added materials. I used <strong>Image Texture</strong>
    instead of just a color and put in the Canvas dashboard PNG that I
    exported from Figma, so the laptop screen shows that image.
  </p>

  <h3>Walls and Floor</h3>
  <p>
    I also added materials to the room itself. I gave the walls some
    texture, and I made the floor look like wood.
