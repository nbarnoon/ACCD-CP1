        <blockquote>
            “Organizations develop their own ‘prototyping cultures,’ which may cause them to consider only certain kinds of prototypes to be valid.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            This quote highlights how some organizations limit creativity by valuing only certain types of prototypes.
            It shows that being attached to one way of working can restrict experimentation and make it harder for new
            ideas to emerge. Openness to different forms of prototyping allows more diverse perspectives and unexpected
            solutions to surface.

        <blockquote>
            “The project leader shared some reflections after this somewhat frustrating experience… he said that part of his goal in pursuing a working prototype alone was to move the project through an organization that respected this kind of prototype more than ‘smoke and mirrors’ prototypes.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            This quote shows how sometimes designers have to adapt to what their organization values.
            Instead of focusing purely on exploration, the designer built something that looked more “real”
            just to gain approval and move the project forward. It reveals that prototyping isn’t only about
            design, it’s also about understanding people, systems, and what kind of work gets taken seriously.

        <blockquote>
            “Integration prototypes help designers to balance and resolve constraints arising in different design dimensions; to verify that the design is complete and coherent; and to find synergy in the design of the integration itself.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            This quote shows that integration prototypes bring everything together, the look, feel, and functionality,
            to test how the design works as a whole. It’s about more than making something look finished; it’s about
            understanding how all the parts connect and influence each other. It reminds me that good design comes from
            finding harmony between different elements, not just perfecting them separately.

    <h3>Programming Design system</h3>

    

    <div class="note">
        <blockquote>
            “Design systems offer a different way of thinking, where the designer is forced to consider many scenarios and constraints instead of relying on a one-off design process.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            This quote shows that design isn’t just about making one thing look good, it’s about creating a structure
            that can work across different situations. A design system helps keep things consistent while still
            allowing flexibility. It makes me think of design as something strategic and scalable, not just visual.

    <div class="note">
        <blockquote>
            “If the designer created the color scale in a regular color space, the perceived colors will be different from the data points reflected in the color values.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            This is important because it illustrates how technical choices significantly impact how users perceive
            visual information. It highlights that color isn’t just aesthetic; it carries meaning. When colors don’t
            accurately reflect the data, the design can unintentionally distort information, reminding us that
            precision in digital color work is essential for clarity and honesty in communication.

    <div class="note">
        <blockquote>
            “Grid systems are an integral part of digital design today. When building digital products, designers use the grid to establish empty containers that can be dynamically filled with content for the individual user.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            This line is important because it explains how grids remain essential in modern design — not as a visual
            rule from print, but as a structural system that supports flexibility in digital interfaces. It captures
            how the grid evolved from a physical constraint in printing to a logical framework that makes responsive
            and adaptive digital design possible.

    <h3>Reflection & Resources</h3>
    <div class="note">
        <p>
            Overall, this reading about design systems resonated with me because I’ve been having similar challenges
            in the project I’m working on. I realized that I need to learn how to create a comprehensive design
            system that the dev team can easily build from, one that’s also Bootstrap-friendly.
