  <h1>Canvas Dashboard Interface in Blender</h1>

  <p>
    I started creating my scene by imagining the context in which users would interact with my redesigned Canvas desktop dashboard. 
    The end users are mostly undergraduate and graduate students, so I decided to build a <strong>student room setting</strong> — 
    a simple, functional workspace with a table, chair, desk lamp, bamboo plant (in progress), and a laptop (in progress). 
    This is the environment where students would use the desktop version of Canvas.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Table / Desk</h2>
  <p>
    The first object I created was the desk. I used the <strong>Mirror Modifier</strong> for the legs to make the modeling process faster 
    and keep the proportions symmetrical. The desk has a simple, boxy shape to reflect a realistic student table, 
    with shelves modeled as scaled cubes under one side for structure and visual interest.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Desk Lamp</h2>
  <p>
    Next, I created a desk lamp using a few simple primitives. 
    I started with a <strong>cylinder for the base</strong>, another cylinder for the stem, and a <strong>UV sphere for the head</strong> of the lamp. 
    I deleted the bottom faces of the sphere to make it a half dome and positioned it to face downward. 
    Finally, I added a <strong>light source</strong> inside the dome to simulate illumination.
  </p>

  <h2>3. MacBook (In Progress)</h2>
  <p>
    The laptop is still in progress. For now, I modeled the <strong>base and screen</strong> using cubes, keeping the proportions realistic. 
    The next step is to angle the screen slightly backward and later texture it with the redesigned Canvas dashboard interface.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Bamboo Plant (In Progress)</h2>
  <p>
    To personalize the space, I decided to add a bamboo plant, inspired by my own workspace. 
    The <strong>pot</strong> was made using a cylinder with the top face inset and extruded inward to hollow it out. 
    For the bamboo stalks, I added several thin cylinders and plan to add leaves later using planes shaped and bent to resemble natural leaves.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Chair (In Progress)</h2>
  <p>
    I began modeling a chair to complete the scene. For now, I’ve created a basic seat, legs, and a rectangular backrest. 
    I’m still experimenting with the proportions and design before finalizing it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, this week’s focus was on <strong>blocking out the main elements</strong> of the environment and using simple modeling 
    techniques like scaling, extrusion, and mirroring. In the next step, I’ll refine proportions, add smaller details, 
    and start texturing and lighting for a more realistic look.
