    <h1>Orbiting Moon & Noise-Driven Comet</h1>
    <p>
      This sketch explores layered motion in a small solar system: a moon and three other planets orbiting a sun with
      trigonometric motion, and a comet that appears at time intervals and follows an organic,
      noise-bent path. The goal was to combine repeated motion, time-based events, and randomness
      to create a de-synchronized, futuristic rhythm.

    <h2>Process & Iterations</h2>

    <!-- Iteration 1 -->
    <figure>
      <img src="images/img1.png" alt="Planet with orbiting moon but no orbit path">
      <figcaption>
        <div class="iteration-title">Iteration 1 – Planet and Moon (No Orbit Path)</div>
        <small>Trigonometric repeated motion</small><br>
        I started with a dark background, a central planet, and a moon moving in a circular orbit using
        <code>cos()</code> and <code>sin()</code>. At this stage, only the motion existed – there was no
        visual orbit line yet, just the repeated movement around the planet.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <!-- Iteration 2 -->
    <figure>
      <img src="images/img2.png" alt="Planet with orbiting moon and circular orbit path">
      <figcaption>
        <div class="iteration-title">Iteration 2 – Adding the Orbit Path</div>
        <small>Clarifying motion visually</small><br>
        Next I added a thin ellipse around the planet to show the orbit path. This made the motion
        more legible and helped emphasize that the moon is following a stable, cyclical trajectory
        rather than just floating around.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <!-- Iteration 3 -->
    <figure>
      <img src="images/img3.png" alt="Simple comet moving without tail">
      <figcaption>
        <div class="iteration-title">Iteration 3 – First Comet (No Tail)</div>
        <small>Time-based second object</small><br>
        I introduced the comet as the second moving shape. It spawns from either the left or right
        edge after a fixed time interval using <code>millis()</code>, then moves across the canvas.
        At this point the comet was just a glowing dot with a simple, almost linear path.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <!-- Iteration 4 -->
    <figure>
      <img src="images/img4.png" alt="Comet with a thin linear tail">
      <figcaption>
        <div class="iteration-title">Iteration 4 – Comet with Thin Tail</div>
        <small>Visualizing motion over time</small><br>
        To show the direction of motion, I added a thin tail behind the comet using a line with a
        smaller stroke weight. The comet still moved in a straight path, but now its trajectory was
        easier to read and it began to feel more like a moving body in space.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <!-- Iteration 5 -->
    <figure>
      <img src="images/img5.png" alt="Comet with a thicker, brighter tail">
      <figcaption>
        <div class="iteration-title">Iteration 5 – Stronger Tail and Fading</div>
        <small>Emphasizing presence and timing</small><br>
        I increased the tail’s stroke weight to give the comet more presence and added a fade-out
        over time using an alpha value mapped from its lifetime. The comet now appears in bursts:
        it shows up, travels, and gradually disappears, reinforcing the idea of a timed event.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <!-- Iteration 6 -->
    <figure>
      <img src="images/img6.png" alt="Comet following a curved, organic path">
      <figcaption>
        <div class="iteration-title">Iteration 6 – Noise-Driven, Organic Comet Path</div>
        <small>Randomness & Perlin noise</small><br>
        I replaced the comet’s linear motion with a noise-bent direction. Each frame, Perlin noise
        slightly adjusts the comet’s angle, and its position is updated with <code>cos()</code> and
        <code>sin()</code>. This creates an organic, curved trajectory that feels less mechanical
        and more like a body drifting under subtle forces.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <!-- Iteration 7 -->
    <figure>
      <img src="images/img7.png" alt="Final scene with custom starfield background">
      <figcaption>
        <div class="iteration-title">Iteration 7 – Custom Starfield Background</div>
        <small>Refining the environment</small><br>
        I experimented with using a photographic space image as a background, but it overpowered
        the animation. In the final version I removed it and instead generated my own starfield by
        randomly placing ~300 stars with different sizes and brightness values. This procedural
        approach keeps the scene cohesive and supports the animation without distracting from it.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <!-- Iteration 8 -->
    <figure>
     
      <figcaption>
        <div class="iteration-title">Iteration 8 – Adding the Sun and More Planets</div>
        <small>Refining the system</small><br>
        At this stage, I turned the central body into a sun with a glowing halo and added more planets
        orbiting around it. Each planet reuses the same trigonometric logic as the original moon, but
        with different radii, colors, and velocities. This created a more dynamic solar system where
        each orbit has its own rhythm.
